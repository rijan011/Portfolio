    <h1 class="article-title">Nepal’s Royal Mystery: A Prince’s Love, A Nation’s Loss
        (1945-2001)</h1><br><br>
        <img class="article-image" src="https://annapurnaexpress.prixacdn.net/media/albums/r_20200601192128_20210602162102_hHgEFdlY9X.jpg" alt="Image description"><br><br>
    <p class="article-intro">The Dark Day of Nepal, a political mystery linked to King Brendra, the
        last king of Nepal, is a subject of intrigue. In 2001, tensions flared
        between 29-year-old Crown Prince Dipendra of Nepal and his parents,
        Queen Aiswarya and King Birendra. The root cause of the family
        conflict lay in Queen Aiswarya’s disapproval of the woman Dipendra
        had chosen to marry, Devyani Rana. The queen vehemently opposed
        the young woman and even threatened Dipendra with disinheritance if
        he disregarded her wishes.<br><br>
        On a summer’s night in Nepal, a drunken Crown Prince, Dipendra Bir
        Bikram Shah ambushed a royal family gathering, opening fire and killing
        nine people, including his father, the King. Tragically, he later turned the
        gun on himself.<br><br>
        
        It’s perhaps one of the most dramatic royal events to have ever occurred
        in our lifetimes, but it doesn’t involve the British monarchy.
        In a single night, Nepal's royal family was almost entirely wiped out.
        Their killer lay in a hospital bed in a coma, having been proclaimed
        King the moment his father died.<br><br>
        The massacre allegedly occurred after an argument between Dipendra
        and his parents, who disapproved of his plans to marry the local
        aristocrat Devyani Rana.<br><br>
        It is believed Dipendra was threatened with being disinherited if he
        continued with the match and this may have been what drove him to
        murder on June 1, 2001.<br><br>
        While we may never know his real intentions, Dipendra wasn't a ruler
        for long. Hours after the massacre, he was declared brain dead and
        his uncle Gyanendra became Nepal's third King in three days.<br><br>
        The events that unfolded shocked the nation, leading to a grieving
        public taking to the streets and rioting for several days. Many were
        astounded that the beloved prince could be responsible for such
        heinous violence. These events marked the beginning of a tumultuous
        period in Nepal, which culminated in the abolition of the country’s 
        monarchy seven years after the massacre. Fueled by public
        resentment towards King Gyanendra, fiercely republican Maoist
        politicians capitalized on the sentiment and secured a majority in the
        constitutional assembly. The country that had once revered its royals
        as living Hindu gods abruptly ordered the surviving family members to
        vacate the palace within 15 days.<br><br>
        The public’s divorce-related thoughts lead this case to a mystery and
        provide a new perspective on the prince’s death.</p><br><br><br><br>
    
    <h2 class="article-subtitle">The Tragic Story of Crown Prince Dipendra: Love, Conflict, and the Royal Massacre</h2><br><br>
    <p class="article-text">Crown Prince Dipendra, the eldest son
        of King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya,
        was cherished by the Nepali people,
        who affectionately called him Dippy.
        But according to Lieutenant General
        Vivek Kumar Shah, an aide-de-camp at
        the royal palace for 26 years who
        knew the Crown Prince since
        childhood, there was another side to
        him.<br><br>
        <img class="article-image" src="https://media.nepaltrekkingplanner.com/uploads/media/king_one.jpg" alt="Image description"><br><br>
        “From the beginning, he likely didn’t
        receive the love he deserved as a
        child,” he shared with The World on
        the 10th anniversary of the massacre.
        Prince Dipendra, educated at the esteemed Eton College, a British
        institution that nurtures future kings and prime ministers, reportedly met
        his beloved, Ms. Rana, who was also studying in England.
        Ms. Rana, the daughter of a prominent Nepalese politician and a
        descendant of an Indian maharajah, seemed like the ideal match for a
        prince.<br><br>
        However, Queen Aishwarya was resolute in her desire to break up the
        relationship and insisted that her son marry a distant relative of the
        House of Shah.<br><br>
        Ms. Rana’s family was also skeptical. While the marriage would have
        elevated her to the position of future queen of Nepal, her mother
        cautioned her that she would have to adapt to a significantly less
        lavish lifestyle.<br><br>
        <img class="article-image" src="https://media.gettyimages.com/id/1310796/photo/in-this-file-photo-dated-april-26-nepalese-crown-prince-dipendra-bir-bikram-shah-dev-left-talks.jpg?s=612x612&w=gi&k=20&c=XNDfWRmgs9G09419ziZPQ-_ZYCULN6navYiQrb-ozto=" alt="Image description"><br><br>
        “Devyani had grown accustomed to extreme comfort and wealth,” the
        Nepali Times reported after the massacre.
        “Her mother further emphasized that Nepali royalty was relatively
        impoverished, and she had to seriously consider whether her daughter
        could survive in a poor household.”<br><br>
        Despite the challenges, Dipendra and Devyani continued to meet in
        secret for years, while the Crown Prince fervently pleaded with his
        parents to allow them to wed.<br><br>
        By 2001, the relationship between the King, Queen, and their first-born
        son had reached a critical juncture.
        Newspaper clippings from that time reveal the Prince’s decision to
        remain unmarried as he approached his thirties, which was
        jeopardizing his status as the heir to the throne.<br><br>
        One article dated May 27, 2001, posed the question, “Why is the
        Crown Prince unmarried at this age? Is his future as the heir to the
        throne in danger?”
        “It is high time His Royal Highness got married. The Nepali people
        eagerly anticipate his wedding, hoping for a grand celebration,” the
        statement concluded.<br><br>
        However, no one could have predicted that a dinner held at the
        palace dining hall just days later would turn into a scene of
        bloodshed.</p><br><br><br><br>

    <h2 class="article-subtitle">The Royal Catastrophe: What Happened in Narayanhiti
        Palace?</h2><br><br>
    <p class="article-text">According to a government report investigating the massacre, Prince
        Dipendra arrived at a dinner party at the palace intoxicated by whiskey
        and high on a special kind of cigarette prepared with a combination of
        hashish and another unidentified black substance.<br><br>
        After a heated argument with another guest, Dipendra was escorted
        back to his chambers by his brother Nirajan and a cousin. From his
        bedroom, he repeatedly called Ms. Rana, claiming that she was
        mistreating him. However, she informed the authorities that he was 
        slurring his speech and that the Prince had informed her during their
        last conversation that he intended to go to bed.<br><br>
        <img class="article-image" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe08d21ac-bc77-4ddc-babd-d2ef268ee262_614x707.jpeg" alt="Image description"><br><br>
        Instead of emerging from his bedroom in his usual attire, the prince
        made a shocking appearance, dressed in army fatigues and carrying
        three guns, including an M16 assault rifle.<br><br>
        A palace aide, who had spotted him at the top of the stairs, initially
        dismissed any concerns, considering the prince’s well-known interest in
        firearms.<br><br>
        
        The dinner party in the billiard room was an exclusive event reserved
        for royals, and as a result, no guards were present to provide security.
        As the Prince unleashed a barrage of gunfire, palace aides sprang
        into action, attempting to break through a glass door to rescue the
        other members of the royal family.<br><br>
        After killing several individuals in the billiard room, the prince
        reportedly made his way to the garden in search of his mother.
        “Please don’t do this. Kill me if you must,” his younger brother,
        Nirajan, reportedly pleaded while shielding the Queen.
        Dipendra, the prince, murdered his parents and younger siblings,
        leaving nine of his relatives dead. After the heinous act, his uncle
        finally stepped forward and demanded that Dipendra hand over the 
        gun. However, instead of obeying, Dipendra shot and wounded his
        uncle before turning the gun on himself.</p><br><br>

  
    <h2 class="article-subtitle">Nepal’s Royal Mystery: Conspiracies Behind the Palace
        Massacre.</h2><br><br>
    <p class="article-conclusion">The timing of the shootings and the immediate shutdown of
        communications within the palace left reporters scrambling for
        information in the ensuing hours. Official reports of the incident were
        scarce, leaving many to wonder who held power.<br><br>
        The event itself seemed almost impossible, like something out of a
        Shakespearean tragedy. A family feud over a forbidden romance had
        escalated into violence and death in a matter of hours.
        However, as the shock wore off, questions and doubts began to
        surface. How could the Crown Prince turn against his family in such a
        violent manner? Were there other forces behind the attack? And why
        did the investigation into the night only last a week?
        The rumors were further fueled by the Prime Minister’s early insistence
        that it was an accident.<br><br>
        <img class="article-image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Narayanhiti_Palace_Museum%2C_crop.jpg" alt="Image description"><br><br>
        “According to the information we have, the incident occurred due to an
        accidental firing of an automatic weapon, resulting in serious injuries to
        the King, Queen, Crown Prince, and other members of the royal
        family,” Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala stated.<br><br>
        The incident was dubbed Nepal’s “Kennedy assassination,” and reports
        suggested that June 1, 2001, would become one of those events
        where people would forever be “forever diagramming the scene on
        pieces of paper, graphing the trajectory of bullets, and speculating
        about other gunmen.”<br><br>
        Following the massacre, an article by Baburam Bhattarai, an
        underground Maoist leader, suggested that the royal murders were the
        result of a “political conspiracy.”
        Two directors of Nepal’s largest newspaper, Kantipur, were arrested for
        treason after the article was published. However, the government later
        dropped the charges due to intense public backlash.
        Other conspiracies focused closer to home, with suspicion falling on
        Prince Dipendra’s unpopular uncle and successor, Gyanendra Bir
        Bikram Shah Dev, who was not present at the palace on the night of
        the massacre.<br><br>
        Wild rumors spread that Gyanendra had colluded with his son, Paras,
        to carry out the murders and frame Dipendra so that they could seize
        the throne for themselves.<br><br>
        Both men vehemently denied any involvement. A former Nepalese
        foreign minister even made unsubstantiated claims that India and the
        US were conspiring to eliminate the royal family. However, some view
        the massacre at the palace as an inevitable consequence of fate.</p><br><br>
